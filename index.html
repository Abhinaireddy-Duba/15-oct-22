	<p>NEW DELHI: Former President Dr APJ Abdul Kalam was born on October 15, 1931 and raised in Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu. He studied aerospace engineering at the Madras Institute of Technology after which he joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).
He was an aerospace scientist who also served as the 11th President of India (from 2002 to 2007) and was widely regarded as the 'People's President'. He contributed immensely to the development of the country both as a scientist and as a president.
He was awarded Padma Bhushan in 1981, Padma Vibhushan in 1990 and Bharat Ratna in 1997 for his work in science and politics.
On his birth anniversary, let's take a look at his 10 big achievements:

India’s first indigenous hovercraft
As a young scientist in DRDO, Kalam was assigned his first project to design and develop a hovercraft for the country’s defense applications. After several days of hard-work, he and his team were successful in developing India’s first indigenous hovercraft which was named Nandi, the impressive white bull who acts as the vehicle of the Hindu deity Lord Shiva.
India’s First Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV)
Dr Kalam put in over 10-year-long hard work as the project director for the development of the indigenous SLV at Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).
In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the ISRO where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980, making India a member of the exclusive space club.</p>
	<p>Avul Pakir Jainelabdeen Abdul Kalam was the 11th President of the country from 2002 and 2007 and is also popularly known as the 'Missile Man' of India. Born in a poor family in Tamil Nadu's Rameswaram, Kalam went on to study physics and aerospace engineering and worked with Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). He also played a role in 1998 Pokhran-II tests under leadership of Atar Bihar Vajpayee. Abdul Kalam was felicitated with a Padma Bhushan in 1981, Padma Vibhushan in 1990 and then received India's highest civilian honour Bharat Ratna in 1997. He is also known for a humble and respectful attitude towards people and was called the 'People's President'. After the end of his tenure as President of the country, he went back to delivering lectures to students and writing. He died after suffering cardiac arrest while delivering a lecture at Indian Institute of Management Shillong on July, 27, 2015. He was buried in his hometown Rameswaram with full state honours.</p>
